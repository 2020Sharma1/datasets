**Description**

We provide our datasets: the iterations and the associated issues, and our source code: the feature aggregations and the randomised ensemble methods to build predictive models.

The dataset consists of the iterations and the associated issues collected from five open source projects: Apache, JBoss, JIRA, MongoDB, Spring. In each project we provide the features of iterations, the features of issues, and the list of issue links extracted from four different prediction times: 0%, 30%, 50%, and 80% of planning duration.


<!-- **Source code**

Our MATLAB source code consists of two main components:(1) the feature aggregations (i.e. Statistical aggregation, Feature aggregation using Bag-of-Words, and Graph-based aggregation) , and (2) the three randomized ensemble methods (i.e. Random Forests, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machines, and Deep Neural Networks with Dropouts) -->
