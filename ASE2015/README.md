*Note* Each dataset consists of task reports and linked data (explicit and implicit links).
1. A task in task reports consists of 3 JSON files:
1.) task details (<Task ID>.json),
2.) comments (<Task ID>_comment.json),
and 3.) change log (<Task ID>_CL.json)
Folder ‘summary’ contains the task summary of each task for applying Topic modelling techniques.

2. Linked data consists of several CSV files. One CSV file is one link type (<Link type>.csv). A link is presented by a pair of task IDs.
