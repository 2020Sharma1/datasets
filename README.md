# Datasets 

## We provide the datasets used in our empirical studies and evaluations. The description is provided according to the type of datasets and the associated work.

### If you use our dataset, please cite our relevant paper in your publication. The ```bib ``` is also provided.

 * * *

There are three groups of datasets according to the dataset's characteristics. 

* [```agile sprints```](https://github.com/SEAnalytics/datasets/tree/master/agile%20sprints)
   
    These are the datasets on the iterative development (e.g. sprint). Our work on these datasets focuses on predicting delivery capability in iterative development. We published the work in [IEEE TSE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7898472/)

* [```delay issues```](https://github.com/SEAnalytics/datasets/tree/master/delayed%20issues)

    These are the datasets on the delayed issues. We used these datasets in our work on predicting delayed issues which we published in [MSR2015](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7180087/), [ASE2015](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2916265), and in [the journal of Empirical Software Engineering](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10664-016-9496-7). 

* [```story points```](https://github.com/SEAnalytics/datasets/tree/master/storypoint)

    These are the datasets on the story point estimation. We provide the datasets and the models from our work on a deep learning model for estimating story points which we published in [IEEE TSE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8255666/).
