# Datasets 

## We provide the datasets used in our empirical studies and evaluations. The description is provided according to the type of datasets and associated work.

### If you use our dataset, please cite our relevant paper in your publication. The ```bib ``` is also provided.

There are two groups of datasets according to the dataset's characteristics. 

* [```agile sprints```](https://github.com/SEAnalytics/datasets/tree/master/agile%20sprints)
   
    These are the datasets on the iterative development (e.g. sprint). Our work on these datasets focuses on predicting delivery capability in iterative development. 

* [```delay issues```](https://github.com/SEAnalytics/datasets/tree/master/delayed%20issues)

    These are the datasets on the delayed issues. We used these datasets in our work on predicting delayed issues.
